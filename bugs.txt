-sometimes blocks don't snap to grid quick enough, and
the tile it was intially on gets lit up (because of high acceleration,
probably).

--game flickers and spazzes if you hit TAB key and debug after visiting the
options menu

-flashlights initially appear at wrong angle and wrong color.

-weird tile graphical glitch where sometimes the tiles appear to
flicker or blend together. (somewhat fixed 10/22/17)

-in the pause menu, sometimes the explosion sound doesn't play,
because the hover sound is still playing. (somewhat fixed 11/7/17, different sound)

-tile allocation is not perfect (set tiles to visible to test). There's
a gap between areas when a new chunk of tiles are created and the 
old ones are deleted. (somwhat fixed 10/22/17)

-menu screen font color changes to black once the game has been restarted 
from the arena menu. (fixed, 10/25/17)

-numbers getting cut off, presumably because the surface is too small (fixed, 10/23/17,
yes, surface was too small) 

-fix the block glowing problem in the arena, again. (fixed, 10/24/17, set glowable to false
each step)

-turrets sometimes intially appear white

-blocks placed on top of numbers do not glow initially.

-some of the tanks are shooting themselves
